# ✅ Backend is Now Running!

## Status: ✅ RUNNING

The backend server is now running on port 5000!

You can see:
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:5000           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Backend

Open in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

Should see: `{"status":"OK","message":"AI-NEXUS Backend API"}`

### 2. Try the Interview Again

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3002/spike/live-interview`
2. Click "Start Interview"
3. Should work now! ✅

### 3. Keep Backend Running

**IMPORTANT:** Don't close the terminal where the backend is running!

If you close it, you'll get `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` again.
